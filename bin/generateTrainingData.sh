# Convert all m4a files to mp3 files. Delete the m4a files.


# Convert all mp3 files to raw format.


# Extract multiple short snippets from each raw file
# These snippets must be long enough that a human can listen to and
# judge its intensity or valence relative to another snippet


# load all of these snippets into an iTunes playlist
# where a human will manually order them from low to high intensity


# extract the manually sorted iTunes playlist
# generate I-numbers from 0 to 1 for all the songs in the training set.


# randomly separate the data into training and test data
# $ALPINE_GIT/machineLearning/sound/training
# $ALPINE_GIT/machineLearning/sound/test

# load all the data into octave
# the raw data for the song snippets go into da matrix
# the I-number labels go into da vector


# invoke da magical machine learning algorithm to give birth to a magical classifier


# now we can use da magical classifier to make prediction on test data. :)
