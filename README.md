# Mission

The mission of the Flere-Imsaho project is "to enable machines to feel emotions
as well or better than the average human."

This area of research is known as [Affective Computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affective_computing).

We believe that software that can accurately feel the shifting emotional state of a
user will enable a revolutionary new kind of emotionally calibrated user experience
that will be render the current generation of software systems completely obsolete.


## Why the strange name?

Flere-Imsaho is the name of a character from the Iain Banks
sci-fi novel
["Player of Games"](http://www.amazon.com/Player-Games-Culture-Iain-Banks/dp/0316005401)

In addition to being an AI, the Flere-Imsaho character is a symbol who represents the idea that a single determined mind who understands the game and knows how to make the right moves at the right moments can be a catalyst for extraordinary transformational change in the universe.


## Plan and Current Status

We will use the [Tellegen-Watson Clarke model](http://bit.ly/1TWdR6y) of affect
by which all human emotions can be descibed via 2 measurable variables:
* arousal
* valence

Our first project involves using machine learning to detect the shifting emotions
of music via the extraction of (arousal, valence) data during the playing of
a musical track.
