% process_full_mp3.m
% The purpose of this script is to generate the intesity profile of a full song.
% Ths song is available in RAW format here
%   $FLERE_IMSAHO/data/audio/user/userfile.mono-sr4000-ss16.raw
% We chop the song up into 2 second segments
% run each through the neural net to out the intensity prediction for each
% then write the complete series of predictions to a file.
% Currently, our neural net can only predict low and high intensities.
% So the output file will contain a series of 1's and 2's.
%
% Input:
%   Environment variables:
%     FLERE_IMSAHO
%     PATH
%     WEIGHTS
%     PNG_DIR
%     RAW_FILE
%     PNG_FILE
%
% Output:
%   a PNG file illustrating the high and low intensity points in the song.
