% Generate a series of plots as PNG files.
%
% Input parameters
% (1) matrix
%     Which of the 3 matrices are we grabbing the data from?
%     value: one of Xtrain or Xval or Xtest
% (2) rows
%     Which rows of the matrix are we grabbing the data from?
%     value: full path to the sorted prediction file
%     first column of this file contains the indices
%     Example:
#       /Users/alexryan/alpine/git/flere-imsaho/data/playlists/output/test-set-true-positives-with-indices.csv
% (3) directory
%     Which file system directory are we actually writing the PNG files to?
%     value: full path the directory where the PNG files should be written
